# Shroom App

The Shroom App is a project for all new and experienced mushroom hunters in Germany. 
It provides a graphical interface to find new search-areas as well as giving orientation on the current probabilities to find something, based on local weather data from Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD).
The application is currently hosted on my private server and can be reached [here](https://vogel-server.de).


## How to contribute
As I'm currently developing this alone, I would really appreciate support! If you have any ideas on how the app could be improved or find a bug, feel free to open an issue or even better, create a pull request.
Especially if you are a web-dev or an expert in mushroom hunting, you may be of great help as I am not a great expert in either of those fields. You can drop me an E-Mail over <mushrooms@vogel-server.de>.
Furthermore the app is currently only targeted at Germany as this is the place where I live and for which I have data. If you come from an other country and want to help expand the app to it, feel free to get in touch with me.

If you want to contribute, please read the installation guide for this repo. It contains information on how to set up a dev environment locally and how the general structure of the app looks like.
